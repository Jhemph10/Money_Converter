# Money_Converter
 The repository for my money converter project
## How to start
use the repository link found on the GitHub page and download the code there. This project is in Java, so use any java based IDE to run the code of the project
## How it Works
This program takes the money that you have deposited into your account and allows you to transfer it into 7 of the most used currencies across the globe
## Important
All currencies start in USD, so your "balance" is always in USD. every time you add and subtract money, it will be in USD as well so you will always be converting money from your original USD balance to the other currency. you will never be adding or subtracting in other currencies
